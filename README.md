# Go JSON server
### A simple JSON server, written in Go.

### Requirements:
+ [Golang](https://golang.org/)
+ Patience (Project still, very much, a work in progress. Nowhere near being complete)

### Running the server
+ Clone this repo: 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/aibhnebreathnach/go-json-server
$ cd go-json-server
```
+ Populate ``` /data ```  with your json to serve. I've provided some test data, which can be changed
```bash
$ cd src
$ go run server.go [port number]
```
And behold in the amazement of JSON being served before your very eyes!
